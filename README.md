# TestingJS
> Helping you select a Javascript Testing framework/library

This dummy application is based on the idea of [Todo MVC](http://todomvc.com/) by [Addy Osmani](https://github.com/addyosmani), [Sindre](https://github.com/sindresorhus), and a lot of [awesome developers](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/graphs/contributors).

These days there are a lot of Testing frameworks and libraries for testing our Javascript applications. Every framework an application has a different approach an some of them are oriented to TDD and other to BDD.

To try to help developers to choose the perfect Testing tool for them, we created TestingJS. It offers a simple VanillaJS application a tested with different frameworks.
