# TestingJS
> Helping you select a Javascript Testing framework/library

This dummy application is based on the idea of [Todo MVC](http://todomvc.com/) by [Addy Osmani](https://github.com/addyosmani), [Sindre](https://github.com/sindresorhus), and a lot of [awesome developers](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc#team).

These days there are a lot of Testing frameworks and libraries for testing our Javascript applications. Every framework an application has a different approach TDD vs. BDD.

To try to help developers to choose the perfect Testing tool for them, we've created TestingJS. It offers a simple VanillaJS application tested with different frameworks.
